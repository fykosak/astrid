About
=====
Astrid is a minimalistic content integration server. It tracks Git
repositories, it can run build tasks on them and expose the built repositories
on the web. Astrid provides simple isolation of different build users with the
help of file permissions.

Installation
============

Quickest way is to install Astrid from Python egg (run `./build.sh` to build
the egg) on the destination machine.

After egg installation, copy configuration files located in 'config' directory
into '~/.astrid' and strip the '.sample' extension. (It is recommended to
create separate user account for astrid daemon.)

Eventually edit the settings for your site.

Run
===
Start Astrid with script 'bin/astrid', it will spawn a background process.

Configure post-receive hook in your Git repository to let Astrid know about
incoming updates. Sample hook is in 'bin/touch-astrid.sh'.
